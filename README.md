# Scraping Code Interpreter

OpenAI's Code Interpreter uses a number of different files for its underlying implementation.

This repo uses GitHub Actions and the OpenAI Assistants API to try and grab copies of those files on a daily basis.

If OpenAI make any changes to these files the changes should show up here in the commit log.

An implementation of the git scraping pattern: https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/
